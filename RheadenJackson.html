    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello, I'm Rheaden Jackson (She/Her), a passionate Computer Science graduate with a unique background in education and communication. My journey is fueled by a deep commitment to driving innovation and tackling complex challenges through technology.<br><br>
        As a Substitute Teacher with the School District of Lee County for the past five years, I've been dedicated to maintaining organized classrooms that foster encouraging learning environments. I've adhered to established lesson plans and curriculums while developing essential skills like teaching, time management, group dynamics, presentation skills, and troubleshooting.<br><br>
        I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Florida International University, where I gained expertise in Git, REST APIs, Scrum, group dynamics, technical writing, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java, time management, and troubleshooting. My educational journey also includes a Bachelor of Arts in Human Communication from the University of Central Florida and an Associate of Arts in General Studies from Florida SouthWestern State College, enriching my presentation, group dynamics, technical writing, and time management skills.<br><br>
        As part of my evolving journey as a software developer, I had the privilege of working on an exciting project. This endeavor involved designing and developing an Online Bookstore and Inventory Management System. I collaborated with a talented team to create a robust and user-friendly platform for book enthusiasts and e-commerce businesses. My primary focus was enhancing the user experience with the Book Details feature, providing comprehensive information about each book, including its author, genre, description, publication date, price, and stock availability.<br><br>
        I am experienced in Postman API, project management, Scrum, RESTful APIs, and Java. I look forward to leveraging these skills and adding to them in the dynamic world of technology to contribute to meaningful and innovative projects. I'm eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities to collaborate and make a difference together. Feel free to reach out and connect!</p>

   <p>As part of my journey as a software developer, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project that involved designing and developing an Online Bookstore and Inventory Management System. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills and collaborate with a talented team to create a robust and user-friendly platform for book enthusiasts and e-commerce businesses.<br><br>
        Our goal was to build a comprehensive web-based platform for both book buyers and sellers. The platform aimed to provide a seamless shopping experience, manage a vast inventory of books, and streamline order processing.<br><br>
        I led the development of the Book Details feature in our Online Bookstore project, enhancing the user experience for book enthusiasts. This feature allows users to access in-depth information about each book, including its author, genre, description, publication date, price, and stock availability. I implemented a user-friendly interface, ensuring that customers can make informed purchase decisions.
